# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to explore how total rides, total drivers, and average fares collected by the ride-sharing organization vary based on whether the location is in an Urban city, Suburban city, or Rural city. In this analysis, we will look at visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Results:
![DataFrame](https://github.com/HappyM0f0/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/dataframe.png)

Based on the data from the Summary DataFrame above, we can see that there are more drivers in the more populated cities, so much so that the Urban located cities have 13 times as many rides as the Rural Cities and 30 times as many drivers. Fares collected in heavily populated areas, and the average fare per ride, decreases by $10 from a rural area to an urban area. The average fare per driver also decreases by around $40. Even the suburban areas have two times fewer rides conducted than the urban area and four times fewer drivers available

![Total Fare by City Type](https://github.com/HappyM0f0/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png)

The figure above shows the average fare (in USD) by city type.
When viewing the PyBer data by city type over time, we can see that the average total fare has a similar pattern over various months between January and April, with total fares peaking around March. Fares in urban cities bring in the most revenue for PyBer, followed by Suburban located cities and then Rural cities. Across the board, fares remain the lowest in January, and fares rise to a peak in late February.

## Summary:
Based on the above results, three recommendations for the CEO of PyBer to address disparity among city types:
- Recruit rural and suburban drivers to increase availability in those areas. Hiring additional drivers will help reduce the average fare per driver.
- Conduct promotional advertising for both consumers and drivers in urban areas to utilize the available drivers better.
- Reduce the total available drivers in urban areas to increase the average fare per driver.
